# 🔥 Tensor Trials

Welcome to **Tensor Trials** — a hands-on deep dive into the fundamentals of **TensorFlow** and **tensor manipulation**. This project is designed to help you build comfort and confidence with tensors, which form the backbone of most machine learning workflows.

> _"The more comfortable you are manipulating tensors, the easier you'll find it to manipulate data later on 💪"_

---

## 📚 What You'll Learn

- How to create, inspect, and manipulate tensors in TensorFlow
- Common TensorFlow methods and operations for data transformation
- Foundations that support deep learning models and data pipelines

---

## 🧠 Motivation

Before diving into model training, it's crucial to have a strong grasp of how data flows through tensors. This repo is like a **bootcamp for your brain** to build tensor fluency using TensorFlow.
